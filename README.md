# Diabetes-Risk-Stratification-RWE
Logistic Regression Analysis on 250k+ patients to identify non-linear risk factors in Type 2 Diabetes
## Summary
This project analyzes a real-world dataset of 253.680 patients to determine the physiological and lifestyle factors contributing to Type 2 Diabetes.

The analysis challenges the assuption of linear risk, applying **Logistic Regression** to quantify how the risk escalates exponentially with BMI categories.

## Key Findings
* **Non-Linear Risk**
* **Exponential grow of risk**
* Intervention protocols should prioritize patients before they cross the obesity threshold, patients knowing this could improve adherence to treatment as they could get more benefit from taking action.

## Visual Evidence

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** R
* **Libraries:** 'tidyverse', 'ggplot2'
* **Technique:** Binary Logistic Regression ('glm'), Odds Ratio Calculation, Data Visualization
